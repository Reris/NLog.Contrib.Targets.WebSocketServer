# NLog.Targets.WebSocketServer

Watch your log from multiple servers in real-time with minimal effort. Merge log outputs from multiple servers in real subscribe to a regular expression and focus in what matters.

NLog.Targets.WebSocketServer is a [NLog target](https://github.com/nlog/nlog/wiki/Targets) that instead of writing on a file, or showing the log on the console, broadcast the log entries through websockets, so web clients can watch the log in real-time.

NLog target that setups a standalone WebSocket server and broadcasts the log entries.

Features:
 * Fully integrated with NLog: it does not require changes in your application.
 * Self-hosted: it does not need IIS or any hosting framework.
 * Mono compatible: Both NLog and WebSocketListener are compatible with Mono.
 * Subscribe to Regular Expressions: Is it possible to send a message throug the WebSocket connection to indicate the expression to which you want to subscribe. Only log entries matching that regex will be sent.
 * Scalable: It uses an asynchronous WebSocket server
